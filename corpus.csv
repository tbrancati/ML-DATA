Lucy in the sky with diamonds;Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you're gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.

Within you without you;We were talking - about the space between us all And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse the truth - then it's far too late when they pass away We were talking - about the love we all could share When we find it - to try our best to hold it there - with our love With our love we could save the world - if they only knew Try to realise it's all within yourself - no-one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small And life flows on within you and without you. We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold And the people who gain the world and lose their soul They don't know, they can't see - are you one of them ? When you've seen beyond yourself Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there And the time will come when you see we're all one And life flows on within you and without you.

Penny lane;In penny lane there is a barber showing photographs Of every head he's had the pleasure to know. And all the people that come and go Stop and say hello. On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, The little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mack In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back In penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine. Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. A four of fish and finger pies In summer, meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray And tho' she feels as if she's in a play She is anyway. In penny lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain, very strange. Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back. Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies, Penny lane.

The ballad of john and yoko;Standing in the dock at Southampton Trying to get to Holland or France The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back" You know they didn't even give us a chance Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Finally made the plane into Paris Honeymooning down by the Seine Peter Brown called to say "You can make it OK You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain" Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton Talking in our beds for a week The newspapers said, "Say what you doing in bed?" I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace" Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Saving up your money for a rainy day Giving all your clothes to charity Last night the wife said "Oh boy, when you're dead You don't take nothing with you But your soul, think!" Made a lightning trip to Vienna Cating chocolate cake in a bag The newspapers said, "She's gone to his head They look just like two gurus in drag" Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Caught an early plane back to London Fifty acorns tied in a sack The men from the press said, "We wish you success It's good to have the both of you back" Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me The way things are going They're going to crucify me

He said, "Rocky, you met your match." Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch. And I'll be better. I'll be better, Doc, As soon as I am able." Now, Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room Only to find Gideon's Bible. Gideon checked out and he left it, no doubt, To help with good Rocky's revival. Ah.. Yeah, yeah.
